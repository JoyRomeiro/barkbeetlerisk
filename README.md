### Description of dataset: 

This repository contains the hypothetical forest stands used for the manuscript "Optimizing forest management in the face of bark beetle risk" and the script used to analyze bark beetle effects on rotation length and NPV.

### Summary of the paper:

The rising impact of the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) on Europe's forests is becoming a major concern, with climate change intensifying the problem. This situation has sparked discussion across Europe about adopting new, adaptive forest management strategies to mitigate the economic impacts on the forestry sector. Despite this, some regions have yet to fully embrace long-term strategies against bark beetle outbreaks from a climate change perspective. In our study, we examined the effects of integrating bark beetle risk into forest management strategies, considering both current and future climate change scenarios. Our findings indicate that reducing rotation length of low density stands with a high proportion of Norway Spruce and situated in more productive sites yields substantial economic advantages. Particularly, regions with a history of bark beetle outbreaks, like Vestfold in Norway, stand to gain significantly from early harvesting. The economic gain from harvesting earlier in this region is projected to increase nearly tenfold over the next 50 years under climate change scenarios. Additionally, we recommend considering the use of mixed tree species within forests as another adaptation strategy, to enhance forest resilience against bark beetle infestations and other natural disturbances.

DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: processing.R:
--------------------------------------------------------
### The script will generate the following outputs:

- summary_table_1: This table summarizes rotation differences and NPV gains by host character and density character. It aggregates the data and provides mean, minimum, and maximum values for rotation differences and NPV gains, grouped by these characteristics. The table is ordered by density character and host character.
- summary_table_2: Similar to summary_table_1, but this table focuses on the aggregation by age character (whether the stands are "old" or "young"). It also provides mean, minimum, and maximum values for rotation differences and NPV gains, grouped by age character.
- summary_table_3: This table aggregates rotation differences and NPV gains by site index (si). It provides mean, minimum, and maximum values for these metrics, grouped by site index.
- max_schedules_aggregated: This table provides aggregated values for NPV gain and rotation differences across a range of environmental conditions (temperature, precipitation) and stand characteristics (host character, density, age). It serves as a high-level view of how these factors interact under different scenarios.
- NPV gain (NOK) figure: This plot visualizes the Net Present Value (NPV) gain across different temperature and precipitation scenarios, faceted by host character, density character, and age character.
- Rotation Difference figure: This plot shows the rotation differences across the same environmental scenarios as the NPV gain figure, also faceted by host character, density character, and age character.
